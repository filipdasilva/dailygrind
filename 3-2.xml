#XML - does this get saved as XML file, how does the XML look when I open in Python?




#socket is application process sends to another application process

#agreeing on a "wire" format

#python serialize then de-serialize to JSON

#JSON and XML two most common ways to send data over internet

#XML uses tags - basic

<person>
    <name>Filip</name>
    <phone type="intl">
        678 999 8212
    </phone>
    <email hide="yes"/>
</person>

#tags named anything we want

#self closing tag, attribute

#XML is tree with parent-child relationships

#XML Schema - description of legal format of XML document - which side's fault is something goes wrong

<complextag>
<sequence>
<element/>
</sequence>
</complextag>

#Schema is what verifies that XML is correct

#XSD constraints

#tag attributes give the data type, ex: string, date, dateTime, decimal, integer

XML = 'UTF-8'

import xml doc as XD
tree = XD.fromstring(data)

#find the name of name tag in XML
print('Name: ', tree.find('name').text)
#hide is the attribute for email
print('Attr: ', tree.find('email').get'hide'))



#find list of user tags example, can iterate through the list

for item in list:
    print('Attribute', item.get("x:"))


``` ``` for xml

item.find and item.get
