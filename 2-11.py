#QQ how can i import these lists?
### [Harrison] Create another python file and import objects from it.
### [Harrison] This is also how you do it w/ functions/classes
### [Harrison] This is exactly how other python modules work.

### [Harrison] list = ['ALL','ASINS','FROM','2021']
### [Harrison] oldlist = ['FROM','2020']

for x in my_list:
    if x in oldlist:
        print(x)
    else:
        print(g)
