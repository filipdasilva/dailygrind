####### I made some comment on your commits.
####### You can check them directly on github.
####### Cleaner that way for now as you've seem
####### To have gotten the hang of git pull etc.
####### However, it'd be best for you to stil ask
####### you're direct questions here as you code.
####### You can leave responses in my comments however.
#######
####### And, you're making really good progress.
